# Made this game in Python
Used Pygame module to make this game in Python. Unfortunately, making 3d games in Pygame is too difficult. So I discontinued using Pygame and hence, now I use Unity to make games
## How to play the game
Just open 'dist' folder and run the setup. 
Note: The game is only for 64-bit.
