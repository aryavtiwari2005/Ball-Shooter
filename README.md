# Made this game in Python
Used Pygame module to make this game in Python. Unfortunately, making 3d games in Pygame is too difficult. So I discontinued using Pygame and hence, now I use Unity to make games
## How to play the game
Just open 'dist' folder and run the setup. </br> 
Note: The game is only for 64-bit Windows. But could be run in Linux or Mac by: </br>
```pip install pygame``` </br>
OR </br> ```pip3 install pygame``` </br>
AND </br>
```python "Ball Blast.py"```
